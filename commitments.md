#How we are going to plan our work.

- We have regular check-ins where we go through our issues and see if we can create new ones and help each other.
- We use Microsoft Teams Chat to communicate.
- We have divided the design assigned to us so that every team member has something to do.
- When we push to Github we always do a PR with at least two reviewers.
- Since this assignment rund over the holidays we have decided to be flexible and humble. We plan on getting it done before we go out on internship but we understand if it might take a bit longer.
